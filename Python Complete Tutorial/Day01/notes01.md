# Python Day - 01

## Software

Software is a collection of programs and programs are the set of instructions.

### Software types:-

* System Software --> OS, Compiler, Driver, Coder, Linker.
* Application --> Desktop Windows
* Web Application
* Device Application
* AI/IOT

## Where we use Python

1. Desktop Application
2. Web Application
3. Network Application
4. Gaming Application
5. Data Science

## What is python?

Python is:

* Open Source --> Anyone can see the source code
* free ware --> No need to purchase
* Procedure + function + OOP's
* Platform independent

## .py vs .pyc

PY files contain Python source code file for a program, while . pyc files contain interpreted bytecode of an application.

## Platform dependent language

If any language creates .exe file they are platform dependent language, while compilation C/C++ code it needs .dll(document linking library file) file which will be provided by OS.

## Platform Independent Language

Software which is on server and which can run on any platform which is provide by an application like python and java  

Python is a Interpreter language it uses JIT (Just in Time) compiler which translate python source code to bytecode(.pyc)

Every OS has Python Virtual Machine (PVM) which only requires bytecode to run the program.  

PVM is a part of Python runtime environment.  

Python do not create .exe fiile

## Features of python

1. High Level Language
2. Expandable --> It can use with other language.
3. Portable --> (loosely coupled) It can portable between different platform.
4. Interpreted language
5. Rich Library

## Limitation of Python

1. Python is slow --> Because it is interpreter based language after using JIT compiler it is better than before.

## Flavour of python

1. CPython
2. JPython | JYThon --> with Java
3. RubyPython
4. IronPython --> with .Net App
5. Anaconda Python --> For BigData Application
6. StackPython --> Multithreaded application
7. PyPy --> Python for Python

## Step by Step Python Code Execution

1. Source Code in python editor | Notepad
2. JIT Compiler --> Converts source code to byte code with extension .pyc
3. PRE(Python runtime Environment) runs the bytecode in the Python Virtual Machine(PVM)

4. Python goes from the two environment:

   * Compile Time environement --> Syntax error
   * Runtime Envrionment --> Exception (error)

## Compile python code in command prompt

```cmd
    python -m py_comiple file.py
```
